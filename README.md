# React Workshop for Cisco

## To run the final projects on your computer

    To run the server:
        git clone https://github.com/StokeMasterJack/api1
        cd api1
        npm install
        node index.js
    
    To run the client:
        git clone https://github.com/StokeMasterJack/app1
        cd app1
        npm install
        npm start

## If you left early
We added some super cool stuff near the end:

* Full routing with URL and back button support.
* Recreated the Pos page using a class-based component.
* CRA's Environment Variable feature
* Error Boundaries to gracefully handle errors in your React components
* Higher Order Components, render functions, useRef hook
* React UI Unit Tests. Check out the src/blackjack directory.

## If you DID stay until the end:
* I cleaned up some of our ad hoc examples and added them to the App1 main menu.
* I finished/fixed the React Unit Tests we were working on. Check them out. They are now pretty awesome.
