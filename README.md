## To run the final projects on your computer

    To run the server:
        git clone https://github.com/StokeMasterJack/api1
        cd api1
        npm install
        node index.js
    
    To run the client:
        git clone https://github.com/StokeMasterJack/app1
        cd app1
        git checkout -b routing origin/routing
        npm install
        npm start

## Routing Branch
Note: The routing example was done on a **_separate branch (called routing)_**. 
All subsequent additions/fixes were done on that branch. So that is the latest and greatest.

To access that branch you can use this command from within your local app1 dir:

    git checkout -b routing origin/routing
