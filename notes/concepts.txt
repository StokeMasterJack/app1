date for UI
    state
    props
    context

Where to put state?

Unidirectional

App (state count , up)
    Page6 props: count up
        StatelessCounter props: count up
            props.count
            up()


Only the component that owns the state can change the state
    That means,  you may need to pass down a callback

Prefer components that take props and have no state

Your component should be idempotent (pure function)
    No side effects
