Data for UI
    state
    props
    context

Where to put state?
    Common parent of components that need access to  it.

Unidirectional
    Data and callback functions only flow down the component tree.
        Can't call parent or siblings.
        Can't modify data of parent or siblings.
        Except through a callback

App (state count , up)
    Page6 props: count up
        StatelessCounter props: count up
            props.count
            up()


Only the component that owns the state can change the state
    That means,  you may need to pass down a callback

Prefer components that take props and have no state

Your stateless components should be idempotent (pure function)
    No side effects
