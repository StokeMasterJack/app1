useState()
useContext()
useEffect()
useRef()      //with a number and with dom component
useForwardRef()   //if want to pass a ref to a custom component that is a child

Hook rules
    Can't be in conditionals or loops
    Typically put near top of component
    Hooks can only be used in a React Component or another hook

More about useState:
    State updaters:  setState(prev => prev + 1)
    Accessing state too soon
    Updating arrays and objects (as state)
    Always use a new object for state
    Never update state from render
    Pure functions
    Lift state up
    Unidirectional
